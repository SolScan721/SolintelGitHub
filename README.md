## üí° Technical Implementation

Our platform leverages cutting-edge AI models and blockchain analytics to provide accurate insights:

```python
def _calculate_overall_risk(self, liquidity_risk, code_risk, transaction_risk):
    """Calculate overall risk score with optimized weighting"""
    # Weights: Liquidity 40%, Code Security 35%, Transaction Patterns 25%
    return (
        0.40 * liquidity_risk["score"] +
        0.35 * code_risk["score"] +
        0.25 * transaction_risk["score"]
    )
```

Example of our contract security analysis:

```python
def _analyze_contract_security(self, token_address):
    """Analyze token contract security risk"""
    # In production: Deep analysis of contract bytecode and behavior
    security_factors = {
        "has_mint_function": self._check_mint_capability(token_address),
        "has_blacklist_function": self._check_blacklist_capability(token_address),
        "has_ownership_transfer": self._check_ownership_functions(token_address),
        "is_proxy_contract": self._detect_proxy_pattern(token_address),
        "similar_to_known_scams": self._check_similarity_to_scams(token_address)
    }
    
    # Security risk score calculation with advanced weighting
    base_score = 100
    if security_factors["has_mint_function"]:
        base_score -= 30
    if security_factors["is_proxy_contract"]:
        base_score -= 20
    if security_factors["similar_to_known_scams"]:
        base_score -= 50
    if not security_factors["has_blacklist_function"]:
        base_score -= 10
        
    return {
        "score": min(100, max(0, base_score)),
        "factors": security_factors
    }
```

## üìä Risk Analysis Methodology

Our platform analyzes tokens based on three primary risk factors:

1. **Liquidity Risk (40%)**
   - Number and diversity of liquidity pools
   - Pool sizes and concentration analysis
   - Price impact simulation for various trade sizes
   - Liquidity depth evaluation across DEXs

2. **Contract Security (35%)**
   - Mint function and supply manipulation risk
   - Administrative privileges assessment
   - Contract upgradeability and proxy patterns
   - Similarity to known scam patterns
   - Ownership and privilege analysis

3. **Transaction Patterns (25%)**
   - Wash trading detection algorithms
   - Price manipulation identification
   - Whale wallet concentration metrics
   - Trading volume consistency and anomaly detection
   - Network graph analysis of token flows
